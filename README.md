In the project directory, we need to run:

### `npm start`


### `npm test`


### `npm run build`

After successfull execution of these commands project is ready to be deployed.

However, there seems to be a problem in deploying the project even after trying to run these commands on the Windows of my pc, it continues to give 404 error on the web page. Though I have deployed this major project along with the minor one on Netlify app but if the error continues to occur, kindly click on the link below to see a demo of this project.
Thank you
